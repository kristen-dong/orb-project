# orb-project
In this project, I created a game application using Java and GUIs while incorporating data-backed findings into the design. 

Game Premise: "In this game, you will help Cornell President Martha Pollack find the Orb of AI in a just-discovered cavern under Gates Hall. You will help her flee (get out quickly) before the cavern collapses."
